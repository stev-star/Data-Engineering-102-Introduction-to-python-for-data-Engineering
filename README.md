# data engineering with python
Python is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. It often ranks high in surveys—for instance, it claimed the first spot in the Popularity of Programming Language index

In Stack Overflow, one of the most authoritative developer surveys, Python consistently ranks at the top; it’s the most wanted and third most loved programming language according to respondents in 2021.

Python for Data Engineering is one of the crucial skills required in this field to create Data Pipelines, set up Statistical Models, and perform a thorough analysis on them.
The rate of data generation has increased throughout this century at a predictable rate more or less. According to Seagate UK, “By 2025, there will be 175 zettabytes of data in the global data-sphere”. Companies place a higher value on data. Companies are discovering new ways to use data to their advantage. They use data to analyze the current status of their business, forecast the future, model their customers, avoid threats and develop new goods.

# What Do Data Engineers Do?

Data engineering is a very broad discipline that comes with multiple titles. In many organizations, it may not even have a specific title. Because of this, it’s probably best to first identify the goals of data engineering and then discuss what kind of work brings about the desired outcomes.

The ultimate goal of data engineering is to provide organized, consistent data flow to enable data-driven work, such as:

- Training Machine learning models
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
- Populate fields with External Data in an application

This data flow can be achieved in any number of ways, and the specific tool sets, techniques, and skills required will vary widely across teams, organizations, and desired outcomes. However, a common pattern is the data pipeline. This is a system that consists of independent programs that do various operations on incoming or collected data. 

## Advantages of using Python for Data Engineering

Data engineering using Python only gets better, and here is a list of points if you are beginning to think otherwise.

1.	The role of a data engineer involves working with different types of data formats. For such cases, Python is best suited. Its standard library supports easy handling of .csv files, one of the most common data file formats.
2.	A data engineer is often required to use APIs to retrieve data from databases. The data in such cases is usually stored in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, and Python has a library named JSON-JSON to handle such type of data.

3.	The responsibility of a data engineer is not only to obtain data from different sources but also to process it. One of the most popular data process engines is Apache Spark which works with Python DataFrames and even offers an API, PySpark, to build scalable big data projects.

4.	Data engineering tools use Directed Acyclic Graphs like Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi, etc. DAGs are nothing but Python codes used for specifying tasks. Thus, learning Python will help data engineers use these tools efficiently.

5.	Luigi! No, not the Mario character by Nintendo; we are referring to the Python module that is widely considered a fantastic tool for data engineering.

6.	Apart from all the points mentioned above, it is common knowledge that Python is easy to learn and is free to use for the masses. An active community of developers strongly supports it.

# Top Python Libraries for Data Engineering

 One of the most important features of Python that makes it a perfect fit for data engineering applications is the libraries that it has. Let us explore which are libraries and how data engineers use them.
 
## Pandas

Pandas is the Python library popular among data analysts and data scientists. It is equally useful for data engineers, who often use it for reading, writing, querying, and manipulating data. The advantage of using Pandas dataframes is they are extremely compatible with two popular data types .csv and JSON. Additionally, dataframe objects have many easy-to-use functions that data engineers can perform quick exploratory data analysis. They can also use it to fix common data problems, such as replacing null values with neighborhood averages, removing columns, etc. Thus, Pandas allows data engineers to transform it into a readable and organized form.

## Psycopg2, pyodbc, sqlalchemy

When one hears the word ‘database’, they are likely to think of data stored in the form of tables having various rows and columns. Such type of a database is called a relational database. There are several ways of interacting with such databases and most of them are based on Structured Query Language (SQL). One such tool popular among data engineers is MyPostgreSQL, and Python contains various libraries to connect to MyPostgreSQL, including pyodbc, Sqlalchemy, and psycopg2.

## Elasticsearch

While relational databases are commonly used in the industry, it is not the only data type. The other types of databases include key-value, columnar, time-series, NoSQL, etc. To handle NoSQL databases (that do not contain data in rows and columns), data engineers usually use Elasticsearch. Python allows users to manage NoSQL databases with its elasticsearch library.
## Great Expectations
While Pandas is an essential library for analyzing data; there is even a better method to draw relevant conclusions from your data. And that method is to use the Great expectations library. It makes it easy for data engineers to clean data equally and allows them to specify their expectations simply. The library takes care of the backend logic, and it does not matter whether your data belongs to a database or is stored in a dataframe. Additionally, it makes it convenient for data engineers to add production-grade validation to a given data.

## SciPy

SciPy, as the name suggests, is a library in Python that offers various functions for quick mathematical computations. A data engineer can use this library to perform scientific calculations on their data for better analysis.

## BeautifulSoup

This is a well-known library used for data mining and web scraping. You will find data engineers using this to extract information from websites, dealing with JSON/HTML data formats, all for preparing their data.
## Petl

Petl is a Python package for extracting, modifying, and loading tabular data. Data engineers use this library for building ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) pipelines.

## pygrametl

This is another library that supports the efficient deployment of ETL pipelines.

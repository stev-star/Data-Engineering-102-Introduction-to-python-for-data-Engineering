# data engineering with python
Python is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. It often ranks high in surveys—for instance, it claimed the first spot in the Popularity of Programming Language index

In Stack Overflow, one of the most authoritative developer surveys, Python consistently ranks at the top; it’s the most wanted and third most loved programming language according to respondents in 2021.

Python for Data Engineering is one of the crucial skills required in this field to create Data Pipelines, set up Statistical Models, and perform a thorough analysis on them.
The rate of data generation has increased throughout this century at a predictable rate more or less. According to Seagate UK, “By 2025, there will be 175 zettabytes of data in the global data-sphere”. Companies place a higher value on data. Companies are discovering new ways to use data to their advantage. They use data to analyze the current status of their business, forecast the future, model their customers, avoid threats and develop new goods.

# What Do Data Engineers Do?

Data engineering is a very broad discipline that comes with multiple titles. In many organizations, it may not even have a specific title. Because of this, it’s probably best to first identify the goals of data engineering and then discuss what kind of work brings about the desired outcomes.

The ultimate goal of data engineering is to provide organized, consistent data flow to enable data-driven work, such as:

- Training Machine learning models
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
- Populate fields with External Data in an application

This data flow can be achieved in any number of ways, and the specific tool sets, techniques, and skills required will vary widely across teams, organizations, and desired outcomes. However, a common pattern is the data pipeline. This is a system that consists of independent programs that do various operations on incoming or collected data. 

## Advantages of using Python for Data Engineering

Data engineering using Python only gets better, and here is a list of points if you are beginning to think otherwise.

1.	The role of a data engineer involves working with different types of data formats. For such cases, Python is best suited. Its standard library supports easy handling of .csv files, one of the most common data file formats.
2.	A data engineer is often required to use APIs to retrieve data from databases. The data in such cases is usually stored in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, and Python has a library named JSON-JSON to handle such type of data.
3.	The responsibility of a data engineer is not only to obtain data from different sources but also to process it. One of the most popular data process engines is Apache Spark which works with Python DataFrames and even offers an API, PySpark, to build scalable big data projects.
4.	Data engineering tools use Directed Acyclic Graphs like Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi, etc. DAGs are nothing but Python codes used for specifying tasks. Thus, learning Python will help data engineers use these tools efficiently.
5.	Luigi! No, not the Mario character by Nintendo; we are referring to the Python module that is widely considered a fantastic tool for data engineering.
6.	Apart from all the points mentioned above, it is common knowledge that Python is easy to learn and is free to use for the masses. An active community of developers strongly supports it.
